Repo for the Restaurant App made by Group 50 of the SE Group Project module

This was a Software Engineering project made by a team of 5 people. The goal was to make a Point of Service application for a restaurant so waiters can use tablets to take orders
and submit them to the kitchen without using paper and pencil. This was coded using Java and FXML.
